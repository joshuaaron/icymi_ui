Notes

<p>There are multiple use cases for this type of UI pattern such as</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Popovers/Tooltips that pop up next to a UI element</li>
        <li>Error messages that appear alongside form controls.</li>
        <li>
          Drop-downs or popover menus that appear next to an associated navigation bar or button.
        </li>
        <li>Settings or options dialogs that can be accessed to quickly configure UI elements.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        however configuring the exact position of these elements to handle viewport overflow,
        scrolling, zooming, animations requires usually takes a lot of work with CSS and Javascript
        and usually external libraries like floating or headless UI.
